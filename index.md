## Welcome 

My name is Wang Jiarui. 

I am an IBI1 student at the Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh (ZJE) Institute.

This is my first website which is made by myself.

I like the color of this theme, hope you like it as well.

You can see the ZJE website [here](https://zje.zju.edu.cn/zje/main.htm)
